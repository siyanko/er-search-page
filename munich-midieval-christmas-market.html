        <h1>Midieval Christmas Market</h1>
        <p>
            Medieval Christmas Market is the special Christmas market in Munich. This is the place, where you can
            return in time and feel how the Christmas was celebrated 500 years ago.
            You'll find there poison drinks, meet knights and enjoy the perfomances of jesters and music of that time.
            Of course, there are lots of presents to buy, from handmade drinking horns and golden jewellery to
            sheepskins.</p>

        <p>Going there you should mind the place is very popular, so you wan't be alone. But visiting it on a
            weekend is a must. On Saturdays and Sundays, music, dances and entertainment are guaranteed. You'll feel
            its mood at most in the evening, when the lights are on. Although, if you want to shop something, it is
            better to come during the week, when it's slightly silent there.</p>

        <p>This is the place for any person, from child to the senior. Munich has lots of Christmas markets, but this
            one is unique, so don't miss it.</p>

        <p>To get there you need to exit at Odeonsplatz and walk to Wittelsbacherplatz via the Brienner street.

            Medieval Christmas Market is located at Wittelsbacherplatz.</p>
